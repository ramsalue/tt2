\chapter{Abstract}
\textbf{Abstract:}
This project aims to develop a robotic orthosis designed to assist in the rehabilitation of patients with hemiplegia affecting the lower right limb. Hemiplegia, caused by strokes, severely impacts mobility, requiring intensive physiotherapy to prevent complications such as muscle atrophy and joint contractures. The robotic orthosis aims to replicate flexion, extension, abduction, and adduction movements in the hip (hip joint) and knee joints, adjusting parameters based on each patient's needs. This automated device will reduce the physical burden on the physiotherapist through an optimized and personalized rehabilitation. The system employs motors to control movements, along with a feedback and trajectory tracking system monitored through a human machine interface.\\

\textbf{Key words}: Robotic orthosis, rehabilitation, hemiplegia, hip joint, knee joint, trajectory tracking.
